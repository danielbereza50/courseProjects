Thank you for responding so quickly. See attached for the Adobe XD file as well as a reference PDF. 
Adobe XD does provide a free download if you do not already have this program.

We would like to see what you can put together between now and Wednesday End of Day and our team will review on Thursday.
 
Some requirements/notes:
We are looking for your overall HTML, CSS and JavaScript (where possible) and troubleshooting abilities. 

The functionality of search, advanced search, my account, and sign out are not necessary for this build but the elements should be present on the page for design sake where possible - DONE

There are two pages, only difference is to display the open vs collapsed version of the nav - DONE

There should be two “status” rows and they should have the ability to scroll left/right - DONE

*note the card has to be the currently active card for the ellipses to work

Looking for the vertical ellipses on at least one card to have a nav pop out (this is optional to include) - DONE

“See All” would display all cards (this is optional to include) - SKIPPED

You may use the same content/text/icons for each card to simplify the amount of HTML needed here - DONE

All icons are font awesome - DONE

Font is poppins which is a google font found here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins - DONE

You can share with us a zip file of your code or github where we can view the code. We will test locally on our machines as well as look at the code developed.
 
If there are any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. If you find you are not able to complete the entirety of this sample, that is OK. We understand this page has a great deal going on. We would rather see at least one finished component than a few started and unresolved components.
